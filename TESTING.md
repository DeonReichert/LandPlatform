## 📋 Test Execution Guide

### 1. Local Mock Testing

**Fast, isolated testing with FHEVM mock**

```bash
npm test
```

**Expected Output:**
```
  ConfidentialLandRegistry
    Deployment
      ✓ should deploy successfully with valid address
      ✓ should set deployer as initial owner
      ✓ should initialize with zero total zones
      ✓ should have correct contract name
    Zone Registration
      ✓ should register a new land zone with encrypted data
      ✓ should increment zone ID for each registration
      ✓ should store correct public information
      ✓ should handle multiple registrations from same owner
    ...

  45 passing (2s)
```

### 2. Sepolia Testnet Testing

**Real network validation with actual FHE encryption**

```bash
# Deploy contract first
npx hardhat deploy --network sepolia

# Run testnet tests
npm run test:sepolia
```

**Expected Output:**
```
  ConfidentialLandRegistrySepolia
    📡 Connecting to Sepolia Testnet...
    ✅ Contract found at: 0xba4FB3D706a6754FFbcF9B01Cc3176F003343d11

## 🔧 Test Configuration

### Hardhat Configuration

Tests use the FHEVM Hardhat Plugin for encryption/decryption:

```typescript
// hardhat.config.ts
import "@fhevm/hardhat-plugin";
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers";
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers";
```

### Test Environment Detection

Tests automatically detect the environment:

```typescript
beforeEach(async function () {
  // Only run on Mock environment
  if (!fhevm.isMock) {
    console.warn(`This test suite cannot run on Sepolia`);
    this.skip();
  }
});
```

## 📊 Test Cases Breakdown

### Deployment Tests (4 tests)

| Test | Description | Expected Result |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| Deploy validation | Verifies contract deployment | Valid contract address |
| Owner assignment | Checks initial owner | Deployer is owner |
| Initial state | Verifies zero zones | `getTotalZones() == 0` |
| Address format | Validates address format | 42-character hex string |

### Zone Registration Tests (5 tests)

| Test | Description | FHE Operation |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Basic registration | Register with encrypted data | `add32(area, population, value)` |
| ID incrementation | Multiple registrations | Zone IDs: 0, 1, 2... |
| Public info storage | Query public fields | `getZonePublicInfo(id)` |
| Multiple from same owner | Same user registers multiple times | All successful |
| Multi-user | Different users register | Each gets unique zone |

### Access Control Tests (4 tests)

| Test | Role | Action | Expected |
|------|------|--------|----------|
| Owner pause | Deployer | `pause()` | Success |
| Non-owner pause | Alice | `pause()` | Reverted |
| Paused operations | Anyone | `registerLandZone()` | Reverted |
| Owner unpause | Deployer | `unpause()` | Success |

### Edge Cases Tests (6 tests)

| Test | Input | Expected Behavior |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| Zero area | `area = 0` | Registration succeeds |
| Max uint32 | `value = 2^32-1` | No overflow |
| Empty description | `description = ""` | Accepted |
| Long description | `description = 500 chars` | Accepted |
| Invalid zone ID | `getZonePublicInfo(999)` | Reverted |
| Concurrent users | 3 users simultaneously | All succeed |

## 🎯 Writing New Tests

### Standard Test Pattern

```typescript
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers, fhevm } from "hardhat";
import { FhevmType } from "@fhevm/hardhat-plugin";

describe("Feature Name", function () {
  let contract: ConfidentialLandRegistry;
  let contractAddress: string;
  let signers: Signers;

  beforeEach(async function () {
    if (!fhevm.isMock) this.skip();
    ({ contract, contractAddress } = await deployFixture());
  });

  it("should do something", async function () {
    // 1. Prepare data
    const clearValue = 100;

    // 2. Encrypt input
    const encrypted = await fhevm
      .createEncryptedInput(contractAddress, signers.alice.address)
      .add32(clearValue)
      .encrypt();

    // 3. Call contract
    const tx = await contract
      .connect(signers.alice)
      .someFunction(encrypted.handles[0], encrypted.inputProof);
    await tx.wait();

    // 4. Verify result
    expect(result).to.eq(expected);
  });
});
```

### FHE Testing Best Practices

1. **Always encrypt sensitive data**
   ```typescript
   const encrypted = await fhevm
     .createEncryptedInput(contractAddress, userAddress)
     .add32(value)
     .encrypt();
   ```

2. **Use proper FHE types**
   - `add8()` → euint8
   - `add16()` → euint16
   - `add32()` → euint32
   - `add64()` → euint64

3. **Decrypt results for verification**
   ```typescript
   const clearResult = await fhevm.userDecryptEuint(
     FhevmType.euint32,
     encryptedResult,
     contractAddress,
     userSigner
   );
   ```

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Common Issues

#### 1. Tests Skip on Mock

**Problem:** Test suite skips all tests

**Solution:** Check environment flag
```typescript
if (!fhevm.isMock) {
  // This will skip on Sepolia
  this.skip();
}
```

#### 2. Sepolia Tests Timeout

**Problem:** Testnet tests timeout

**Solution:** Increase timeout
```typescript
it("should work on Sepolia", async function () {
  this.timeout(4 * 60000); // 4 minutes
  // ...
});
```

#### 3. Encryption Fails

**Problem:** `createEncryptedInput()` fails

**Solution:** Verify contract address and user address
```typescript
const encrypted = await fhevm
  .createEncryptedInput(
    contractAddress,    // Must be deployed contract
    signers.alice.address  // Must be valid signer
  )
  .add32(value)
  .encrypt();
```

#### 4. Transaction Reverts

**Problem:** Contract call reverts unexpectedly

**Solution:** Check contract state and permissions
```typescript
// Verify not paused
const isPaused = await contract.paused();
expect(isPaused).to.be.false;

// Verify caller has permission
await expect(
  contract.connect(signers.alice).ownerFunction()
).to.be.reverted;
```

## 🆘 Getting Help

### Test Failing?

1. Check console output for error messages
2. Verify contract is deployed (for Sepolia tests)

4. Review test logs for specific failure point

### Need More Tests?

Follow the patterns in existing test files:
- `test/ConfidentialLandRegistry.ts` - Mock environment
